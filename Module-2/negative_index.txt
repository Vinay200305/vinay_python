Q: What are negative indexes and why are they used?

=> Negative indexing allows you to access elements of a sequence from the end.

=> For Example, in a list with 5 element, the last element can be accessed using the index -1, the second 
    last would be -2, and so on.

=> Example:
    mylist = ['a','b','c','d']
    print(mylist[-1])

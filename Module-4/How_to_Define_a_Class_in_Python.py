# How to Define a Class in Python? What Is Self? Give An Example Of A Python Class

'''

* A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.
* Self represents the instance of the class.
* By using the “self”  we can access the attributes and methods of the class in Python.
*It is customary to use “self” as the first parameter in instance methods of a class.
* Whenever you call a method of an object created from a class, the object is automatically passed as the first argument using the “self” parameter.

#Inheritance in Python :

* Inheritance is defined as the mechanism of inheriting the properties of the base class to the child class.

* There are main three types of inheritance in Python:

1. Single Inheritance : Single inheritance enables a derived class to inherit properties from a single parent class it's called single level inheritance.
2. Multiple Inheritance : When a class can be derived from more than one base class this type of inheritance is called multiple inheritances.
3. Multilevel Inheritance : In multilevel inheritance, features of the base class and the derived class are further inherited into the new derived class. This is similar to a relationship representing a child and a grandfather. 
4. Hierarchical Inheritance : When more than one derived class are created from a single base this type of inheritance is called hierarchical inheritance. In this program, we have a parent class and two child classes.


What is init? Or What Is A Constructor In Python? :

* In Python, a constructor is a special method that is called when an object is created.
* The purpose of a python constructor is to assign values to the data members within the class when an object is initialized.
* The name of the constructor method is always __init__.

#Q-1 : Explain Exception handling?

#> When a Python program meets an error, it stops the execution of the rest of the program.
> An error in Python might be either an error in the syntax of an expression or a Python exception. 
> We will see what an exception is. 
> Also, we will see the difference between a syntax error and an exception in this tutorial.
> An exception in Python is an incident that happens while executing a program that causes the regular course of the program's commands to be disrupted.
> When a Python code comes across a condition it can't handle, it raises an exception. 
> An object in Python that describes an error is called an exception.




#Q-2 : What is an Error in Python?

=> There are (at least) two distinguishable kinds of errors: syntax errors and exceptions.
1.  Syntax Errors :
    * Syntax errors, also known as parsing errors.
    * The parser repeats the offending line and displays little ‘arrow’s pointing at the token in the line where the error was detected.
    * The error may be caused by the absence of a token before the indicated token.


2.  Exceptions :
    > Even if a statement or expression is syntactically correct, it may cause an error when an attempt is made to execute it.
    > Errors detected during execution are called exceptions and are not unconditionally fatal: you will soon learn how to handle them in Python programs.
